Nathaniel Hoefer's Reference Documentation
===============================================================================

This is the one-stop shop for all of my personal reference documentation.
The primary goal of this endeavor is to centralize any information that I pick up throughout my software engineering journey,
and organize it in a way that is easily accessible while also maintainable.
As such, the documentation will never be completed, but will hopefully continue to grow and mature as I do.

.. admonition:: Disclaimer

   I must emphasize that all information documented is for *personal* use,
   therefore it is far from comprehensive and may contain a number of errors.
   With that said, feel free to use this as a reference if you can find use for anything documented.
